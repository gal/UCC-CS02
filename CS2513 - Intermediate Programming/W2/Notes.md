# CS2513 Week 2 - Classes

## Encapsulation

- First and most basic principle of OOP
- Describes real world entities (**Classes**) in terms of behaviours (**Methods** - actions) and states (**Attributes** - details)
- Change state through the use of **behaviours**
  - Makes code more **robust** by controlling how and when an attribute is changed
  - Means we can **parallelise** work easily
  - Allows the code to be loosely bound

## What is a Class

- A class is a special **Datatype** which defines how to **build** a certain kind of **object**
- The class also stores some **data items** that are shared by all the **instances** of this class
- Instances are objects that are created which follow the **definition** given inside of the class
- Python **doesn't** use separate class interface definitions as in some languages
  - You just define the class then use it

## What is an Object

- Objects are the basic run-time entities in an object-oriented system
- They may represent a person, a place, a bank account, a table of data or any item that the program must handle
- When a program is executed the objects interact by sending messages to one another
- Objects have two components
  - Data (i.e Attributes)
  - Behaviours (i.e Methods)
