## Abstract Data Types

**Doesnt necessarily specify how they should be used**

- Does it work as it should
- How long does it take
- How much memory and recourses does it use

---

## What is the point

### Proper Implementation

1.  Programs must be correct

    - Not just bug free but working as best as possible

2.  Programs should be efficient
    - Programs that take too long to run are useless
    - Understand the implication of choosing certain library functions in regard to runtime and memory use
    - Implications of different desing pattern choices
      - What might be easier for you to code may be worse for the programs runtime overall

### Efficiency

1.  Faster machines mean users expect to solve bigger problems faster
2.  Some problems have known limits in their efficiency

---

## What is the point (Cont.)

1.  You must advertise and explain code to other programmers _in ways they will understand_

    - State the Abstract Data Types used
      - Experienced Programmers will know how to interact with them
    - State the data structures and algorithms you've implemented

2.  You should not break standard design patterns and principles
    - Understand the specificed ways you're meant to interact with the data
    - Don't interact with it in any others ways

---

## What we will use

**Python 3**

- Understanding library functions
- Learn how to implement code and data structures properly
- Practice coding skills regularly

---

## Module Requirements

- Most lab classes wont be a hand-in style assignment but they are still important for growing your skills and understanding
- Using things thought during CS113 - Foundations of Computer Science II ([Reference past material if needed](https://bit.ly/3l0GQrG))
- There is no text book here are some recommended reading if you feel the need
