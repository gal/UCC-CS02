# Week 1 - Intro

### Abstract Data Types

**Doesnt necessarily specify how they should be used**

- Does it work as it should
- How long does it take
- How much memory and recourses does it use

### Whats the point

#### Proper Implementation

1.  Programs must be correct

    - Not just bug free but working as best as possible

2.  Programs should be efficient
    - Programs that take too long to run are useless
    - Understand the implication of choosing certain library functions in regard to runtime and memory use
    - Implications of different desing pattern choices
      - what might be easier for you to code may be worse for the programs runtime overall

#### Efficiency

1.  Faster machines mean users expect to solve bigger problems faster
2.  Some problems have known limits in their efficiency

### What is the point (pt.2)

1.  You must advertise and explain code to other programmers _in ways they will understand_

    - State the Abstract Data Types used
      - Programmers know how to interact with them
    - State the data structures and algorithms you've implemented

2.  You should not break standard design patterns
    - Understand the specificed ways to interact with data
    - Dont interact with it in any others ways to ease maintainability

## What we will use

**Python3**

- Understand library functions
- Learn how to implement structures properly
- Practice coding skills regularly

## Module Requirements

- Most labs wont be hand-in but are important for honing skill
- Using things thought during CS113 - Foundations of Computer Science (Reference past material if needed)
- There is no text book there are some recommended reading

  - Data Structures and Algorithms in Python, Goodrich, Tamassia and Goldwasser, Wiley

  - Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures, Miller and Ranum

  - Data Structures and Algorithms with Python, Lee and Hubbard, Springer
